			-PIZZA-
			I am very foodie. I love to eat and cook.The food gives us energy.
			Without food,there is no life.The pizza itself looks so yummy, 
			crispy and so cheesy. There is no better feeling in the world 
			than a warm pizza box on your lap.My love for Pizza is very high. 
			I am always hungry for pizza, be it any time of the day.
			There are times when I get scolded for having pizza
		    all the time because anything in excess causes harms to 
		    our health but a pizza lover will always be a pizza lover. 
		    There is something between me and pizza the bond which cannot be broken.

			My favourite singer is ED SHEERAN. He was born in 1991 in England and is a famous English singer, song-writer
            and record producer.He started his music career at four when he sang in a churchchoir. When he was a teenager he learnt to play the guitar and
            started to write songs.Ed Sheeran is very successful (erfolgreich). He and his songs have received many nominations and awards both in England and abroad. In 2014 he won the “British Artist of the Year” award, and in 2018 his album “Divide” won the Grammy Awardas the Best Pop Vocal album of the year.I like the singer because he has not only catchy songs but he also cares about his fans. He often gives away his clothes to
            charity institutions.
