		<center><h3><strong>-What can I say about myself?-</h3></center>
		<p>Well,we can say many things-good and bad-but we all want to be able to say things that will make us 	feel good about ourselves and our influence on others.If you want to be successful,if you want to be happy ,if you want to be healthy,the way to cultivate that life is to know that you are living a life that is meaningful.</p>

		<center><h3></h3></center>
		<p>I FOLLOWED MY HEART- Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. Be able to say that you didn"t let fear hold you back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.. I BELIEVE IN MYSELF- Even if you fail,it doesn"t mean you will continue to fail.Be able to say you believed in yourself and kept trying.Everything that is successful will begin with you believing in yourself..I LIVE MY HIGH STANDARDS-Never apologize for high standards:people who really want to be in your life will rise up to meet them.The quality of who you are is reflected in the standards you set for yourself;position yourself to live up to the rise of your own expectations.I TREAT OTHERS THE WAY I WANT TO BE TREATED-Talk to people the way you want to be spoken to;respect people as you wish to be respected.Your status,religion,race,political views,or culture don"t matter-being a good person really is as simple as following  the golden rule and treating others as you would like them to treat you.I UNDERSTAND HOW PRECIOUS TIME IS-Be able to say that you didn"t waste time.Remember that time is free priceless,that you can"t own it but you can spend it-wisley or unwisley.Treat time as a resource to be invested carefully.</p>

		<p>I LOOK FOR POSITIVITY IN ALL THINGS-Instead of thinking of all things that can go wrong ,become one of the people who look on how they go right.Your mind is powerful,and when you fill it with positivity your life naturally becomes positive.When you think positive thoughts,positive things will happen.I TRUST MY INTUITION-Don"t let anyone talk out of what you know to be true.Trust your inner voice and allow yourself to be led by your intuition.The more empowered you become,the stronger you become and happier you become.Avoid going against your better judgment or getting talked into things that don"t feel right.I SPEAK UP-When you don"t speak up for things that matter to you,you are not being true to yourself.When you speak your mind,you stand with confidence and gain courage.I AM A TOUGH PERSON WHO HAS MADE IT THROUGH TOUGH TIMES-The time when life is toughest are often the times that lead you to the most meaningful discoveries.When times are tough,dare to be toughter.Anyone can run away,but facing problems and working through them makes you strong..I AM GOOD AT LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THEY MATTER-No matter how busy you are,make time to let people know they matter.Be there for them,make plans with them,set aside time for relationship.</p>
        
        <p>I AM A RESPONSIBLE PERSON-Don"t be the person who blames or make excuses.One of the most keys to success is having the dicipline to do what you should do even when you don"t feel like doing it-and those daily decisions often involve taking responsibility for your own choices and actions.Remember that your actions do affect other people,so always be careful with what you say and you do.12.I AM GRATEFUL-Gratitude will always make you happy.If you have a hard time finding something to be grateful for,look around you and watch how other people are struggling.Be greateful you have it better,then go out and help others.At the end of the day ,it"s not that happy people are thankful but that thankful people are happy.I HAVE FORGIVEN THOSE WHO HAVE HURT ME-Forgiveness takes great strength,but few things are more worth the effort.Life becomes easier and business becomes more manageable when you learn to forgive.The alternative is an endless cycle of resentment and retalation that strips your energy and humanity.I HAVE NO REGRETS-Be able to say you took chances,you told the truth,you wronged a right,you spent time with those you love,you followed your heart and lived your passion,you forgave and moved forward with fortitude.The worst form of regret is regret for the chances we didn"t take..I AM MAKING A DIFFERENCE-Don"t tire of doing little things for others,because sometimes those little things occupy the biggest part of their heart.In life we cannot always do great things,but,as Mother Teresa said:WE CAN ALWAYS DO SMALL THINGS WITH GREAT LOVE.At the end it is not only making a living,it is about making a difference.</p></table>
